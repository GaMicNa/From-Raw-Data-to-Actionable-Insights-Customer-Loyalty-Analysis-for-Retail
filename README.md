In order to present a business intelligence plan for the digital platform of Electronic Commerce, focused on customer retention and loyalty, I selected the following key indicators (kpis):

- **Customer Retention Rate:** measure the loyalty of customers towards a business over a specific period of time.
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):** indicates the average value (money) that a customer has contributed to the company throughout their entire relationship with it.
- **Ratio Upsell:** indicates the ability to persuade our current customers to choose us for purchasing other types of products.
- **Client Retention Rate:** this measures how many products are returned by customers after purchase.
- **Re-buying Rate:** this index allows to know the percentage of buyers who repeat among your customer base.
- **Cart Abandonment Rate:** This index measures the proportion of customers who add products to the online shopping cart but do not complete the purchase.
- **Churn Rate:** this index measures the proportion of customers lost within a certain period.
